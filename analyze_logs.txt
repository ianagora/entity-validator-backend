The logs show:

For UNITED KENNING RENTAL GROUP LTD (02942541):
- ⚠️ WARNING: OpenAI returned empty shareholders list despite 8821 chars of text
- ❌ Regex extraction found no shareholders

But I don't see the expected debug output:
- "📋 DEBUG: OCR text sample (first 3000 chars): ..."
- "📊 DEBUG: Found X 'Shareholding' entries but regex only matched Y"

This suggests the debug logging we added in commit d5886b9 is NOT actually running!
